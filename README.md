Here is the feedback

**Intuitive or Good:**

1. **Async Functions for Transactions:** I found using async functions for transactions to be a breeze. Their familiarity in JavaScript made handling asynchronous operations smooth and efficient, especially compared to other methods like hooks.

2. **Thirdwebprovider Context:** Leveraging the Thirdwebprovider as context for blockchain interactions was a great choice. It helped encapsulate blockchain-related functionality neatly within my application, making it easily accessible and organized.

3. **Documentation:** While I did encounter some discrepancies, certain parts of the SDK's documentation were clear and helpful in guiding my development process. Clear documentation is always a huge plus in my book.

**Not Intuitive or Difficult:**

1. **Importing Client in getContract:** I struggled with importing the client module within the `getContract` function, despite using the Thirdwebprovider context. It felt like there was a disconnect between the documentation and the actual implementation, making integration challenging.

2. **Chain ID vs. Chain in BigNumber:** The inconsistency between the documentation stating `chainId: 1` and the alpha SDK using `chain: chainId` within a BigNumber object threw me off. Inconsistent documentation can really slow down the development process and lead to confusion.

Reflecting on my experience, it's clear that while certain aspects of the SDK were intuitive and smooth, others presented challenges that required extra time and effort to overcome. Moving forward, I'll be sure to reach out to the community or support channels for assistance when encountering roadblocks.
